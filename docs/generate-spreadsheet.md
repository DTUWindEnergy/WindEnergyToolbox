Auto-generation of DLB Spreadsheets
===================================

Introduction
------------

This manual explains how to automatically generate the set of spreadsheets that
define a DLB and are required as input to the pre-processor.

This tool comes handy in the following scenarios:

    * a DLB for a new turbine needs to be generated;
    * a different wind turbine class needs to be evaluated;
    * a new parameter needs to be included in the htc file;
    * different parameters variations are required, e.g. different wind speed
    range or different number of turbulent seed.
